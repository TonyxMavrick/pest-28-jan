        <p>Termites cause billions of dollars in property damage each year in the United States alone. While these tiny pests work silently behind walls and under floors, the damage they cause can be devastating. The good news? With proper prevention strategies, you can significantly reduce your risk of termite infestation.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Threat</h2>
        <p>Termites feed on cellulose, which is found in wood and other plant materials. They can enter your home through cracks as small as 1/32 of an inch and establish colonies that number in the hundreds of thousands. Once established, they can cause structural damage before you even know they're there.</p>

        <h2>10 Essential Prevention Tips</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Eliminate Moisture Problems</h3>
        <p>Termites are attracted to moisture. Fix leaky faucets, water pipes, and AC units. Ensure proper drainage away from your foundation and keep gutters clean and functional.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Remove Wood-to-Ground Contact</h3>
        <p>Wood siding, door frames, and wood piles should never touch the soil. Maintain at least 6 inches of clearance between wood portions of your home and the ground.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Store Firewood Properly</h3>
        <p>Keep firewood, lumber, and paper away from your foundation. Store wood at least 20 feet from your home and 5 inches off the ground.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Maintain Your Foundation</h3>
        <p>Seal cracks and crevices in your foundation with caulk. This not only helps prevent termite entry but also improves energy efficiency.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Reduce Humidity</h3>
        <p>Use dehumidifiers in basements and crawl spaces. Ensure proper ventilation in attics and crawl spaces to prevent moisture buildup.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Remove Dead Trees and Stumps</h3>
        <p>Dead trees, stumps, and roots near your home can attract termites. Have them removed and consider replacing with termite-resistant landscaping.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Keep Mulch Away from Foundation</h3>
        <p>While mulch is great for gardens, it retains moisture and can provide an ideal environment for termites. Keep mulch at least 15 inches away from your foundation.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Trim Trees and Shrubs</h3>
        <p>Maintain a clear zone around your home. Trim branches that touch your house and keep shrubs pruned to allow air circulation.</p>
        
        <h3>9. Install Physical Barriers</h3>
        <p>Consider installing termite shields or sand barriers during construction or renovation. These physical barriers can help prevent termite entry.</p>
        
        <h3>10. Schedule Regular Inspections</h3>
        <p>Professional termite inspections should be conducted annually. Early detection is key to preventing major damage.</p>
